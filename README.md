linkedInGoogleDocSaver
======================

Save linkedin profiles to a google doc using Zapier.

This software is provided under the GPLv3 and MIT liscense.  
I made this for a friend over a few hours to help him recruit people off of linked in.

The chrome extension basically injects a button into linkedin profiles that says, "Save to google docs".  
When the button is pressed, the extension scrapes the linkedIn profile and calls a zapier endpoint.
Zapier (if configured correctly) will save the webhook's payload to a google spreadsheet row.
